# PROMPT: Generate a Full-Stack Company Report Application

## 1. Core Objective
Create a complete, production-ready, full-stack Next.js application that allows users to generate a detailed company report based on a company name. The application should have a professional, modern, and clean user interface using ShadCN UI components and Tailwind CSS.

## 2. Technology Stack
- **Framework:** Next.js 14 (App Router)
- **Language:** TypeScript
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS
- **UI Components:** ShadCN UI (pre-installed in the project)
- **AI/Backend:** Genkit with Google AI (Gemini)
- **Icons:** lucide-react

## 3. Application Structure & Pages

### 3.1. Main Page (\`/src/app/page.tsx\`)
- **Layout:** A single-page interface, centered on the screen.
- **Header:** A clean, bold title like "AI Company Report Generator".
- **Input Form:**
    - A form built with ShadCN's \`Form\`, \`Input\`, and \`Button\` components.
    - Three input fields:
        1.  'Full Name' (text input)
        2.  'Phone Number' (tel input)
        3.  'Company Name' (text input) - This is the primary input for the report.
    - All fields must be required and include basic validation (e.g., name length, valid phone format, company name not empty).
- **Submit Button:** A prominent button labeled "Generate Report". It should show a loading spinner/state while the report is being generated.
- **Report Display Area:**
    - Initially, this area should be empty or show a placeholder message like "Your company report will appear here."
    - After generation, the report should be displayed here in a well-structured and styled format.

### 3.2. Genkit AI Flow (\`/src/ai/flows/company-report-flow.ts\`)
- This file will contain the core AI logic. It should be a Next.js Server Action file ('use server').
- **Input Schema (Zod):**
    - \`name: z.string()\`
    - \`phone: z.string()\`
    - \`companyName: z.string()\`
- **Output Schema (Zod):**
    - The schema must define the structure of the entire company report. Be comprehensive.
    - \`companyProfile\`:
        - \`name: z.string()\`
        - \`summary: z.string().describe("A 1-2 paragraph executive summary of the company.")\`
        - \`industry: z.string()\`
        - \`foundedDate: z.string()\`
        - \`keyExecutives: z.array(z.object({ name: z.string(), title: z.string() }))\`
    - \`swotAnalysis\`:
        - \`strengths: z.array(z.string()).describe("A list of 3-4 key strengths.")\`
        - \`weaknesses: z.array(z.string()).describe("A list of 3-4 key weaknesses.")\`
        - \`opportunities: z.array(zstring()).describe("A list of 3-4 key opportunities.")\`
        - \`threats: z.array(z.string()).describe("A list of 3-4 key threats.")\`
    - \`marketPresence\`:
        - \`keyCompetitors: z.array(z.string()).describe("A list of 3-5 main competitors.")\`
        - \`marketPosition: z.string().describe("A summary of their position in the market (e.g., Leader, Challenger, Niche).")\`
    - \`recentNews\`:
        - \`articles: z.array(z.object({ title: z.string(), summary: z.string(), source: z.string() })).describe("A list of 2-3 recent, relevant news articles.")\`
- **Genkit Prompt:**
    - Use \`ai.definePrompt\`.
    - The prompt should clearly instruct the AI model (Gemini) to act as an expert business analyst.
    - It must use the user-provided \`companyName\` as the subject.
    - The prompt should instruct the model to search for public information and generate a comprehensive report that STRICTLY adheres to the defined output schema.

### 3.3. Server Action (\`/src/app/actions.ts\`)
- Create a new exported async function \`getCompanyReport(input: CompanyReportInput): Promise<CompanyReportOutput>\`.
- This function will call the Genkit flow created in the previous step.
- It should include robust error handling (try/catch block) and return a structured object indicating success or failure.

## 4. User Experience & UI Details
- **Loading State:** When the "Generate Report" button is clicked, it should become disabled, and a loading spinner (e.g., \`<Loader2 className="animate-spin" />\`) should appear.
- **Report Display:**
    - Use ShadCN \`Card\` components to structure the report.
    - The main sections (Company Profile, SWOT Analysis, etc.) should be distinct cards or sections within a larger card.
    - Use \`CardHeader\`, \`CardTitle\`, \`CardDescription\`, and \`CardContent\`.
    - Use lists (\`<ul>\`, \`<li>\`) for arrays like Strengths, Weaknesses, Competitors, etc. Use a \`<Check />\` icon from lucide-react for each list item for better visual appeal.
- **Responsiveness:** The layout must be fully responsive, stacking cleanly on mobile devices.

## 5. Final Implementation Steps
1.  Create the main page UI in \`/src/app/page.tsx\`.
2.  Implement the Genkit flow with Zod schemas in \`/src/ai/flows/company-report-flow.ts\`.
3.  Create the server action wrapper in \`/src/app/actions.ts\`.
4.  Connect the front-end form to the server action, handle the loading state, and render the resulting report data.
5.  Ensure all styling is clean, modern, and consistent with the ShadCN design system.

# Component Analysis: NavigationMenu vs. DropdownMenu vs. MegaMenu

## 1. Core Objective
To clarify the distinct roles of the primary navigation components used in this application's header architecture. Understanding when and why to use each component is critical for maintaining code quality, accessibility, and a consistent user experience.

## 2. Component Breakdown

### 2.1. \`NavigationMenu\`
- **Source:** \`shadcn/ui\` (based on Radix UI)
- **Purpose:** This is the **foundational component for top-level site navigation**. It is specifically designed to handle the complex requirements of a main navigation bar.
- **Key Features:**
    - **Accessibility:** Manages complex keyboard navigation (arrow keys, \`Tab\`, \`Esc\`), focus trapping, and provides essential ARIA attributes out of the box. This is its most important feature.
    - **State Management:** Automatically handles the open/closed state of its dropdowns.
- **Usage:** This should be used once, at the top level of your main desktop navigation bar, to wrap all the primary navigation links. In our project, it's the root of \`desktop-nav.tsx\`.

### 2.2. \`DropdownMenu\`
- **Source:** \`shadcn/ui\` (based on Radix UI)
- **Purpose:** A **generic, multi-purpose pop-up menu**. It is not designed for main site navigation but is perfect for simpler, action-oriented menus.
- **Key Features:**
    - **Simplicity:** Ideal for context menus, user profile dropdowns, or settings toggles where a single button reveals a list of actions.
    - **Trigger-Based:** Built around a single \`DropdownMenuTrigger\` (e.g., a button or an icon) that opens a panel of options.
- **Usage:** In our project, this is used for the \`ThemeToggle\` component. It is the correct choice for simple, single-trigger menus that are not part of the main page-to-page navigation flow.

### 2.3. \`MegaMenu\`
- **Source:** **Custom Component** (\`src/components/header/mega-menu.tsx\`)
- **Purpose:** This is a **design pattern**, not a primitive component. It defines the rich, multi-column layout that appears *inside* a \`NavigationMenuContent\` panel.
- **Key Features:**
    - **Rich Content:** Its sole job is to arrange navigation links into a structured, multi-column grid with headings, descriptions, and promotional blocks (CTAs).
    - **Data-Driven:** It is driven by our centralized \`menu-data.ts\` file, dynamically rendering its content based on the provided \`menuKey\`.
    - **Composition:** It is always nested within a \`NavigationMenu\` and does not manage its own state or accessibilityâ€”it inherits these from its parent.
- **Usage:** In our project, this is used to render the large dropdowns for "Products," "Industries," and "Company."

## 3. Architectural Analogy

- **`NavigationMenu`** is the **entire bookshelf**, specifically built to organize your main library of books.
- **`DropdownMenu`** is a **small, single-purpose spice rack** on the kitchen counter.
- **`MegaMenu`** is a **custom-built organizer** that you place *on a shelf* of the main bookshelf to neatly arrange a specific category of books into sections.

By adhering to this separation of concerns, we ensure our navigation is accessible, maintainable, and scalable.
